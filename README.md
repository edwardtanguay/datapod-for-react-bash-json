# datapod-for-react-php-json

This is a simple datapod template for a local site that displays data from a JSON file, which is created by a PHP script that parses a text file.

## Compatibility

-   ✔️ tested on Windows (not recommend, need to install jq.exe etc. not straight-forward, bash is more for Linux/UNIX)
-   ✔️ tested on Ubuntu (see setup below)

## Set up

-   `npm i`
-   `npm run dev`
-   install jq (for creating JSON files)
    -   `sudo apt-get update`
    -   `sudo apt-get install jq`
